# Batch-Builder

A decentralized toolkit for streamlined batch processing and collective task management on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Batch-Builder provides a flexible framework for coordinating complex, multi-step processes through smart contracts, enabling:

- Efficient batch processing of transactions
- Decentralized task coordination
- Secure, transparent workflow management
- Modular contract architecture for adaptable use cases

## Smart Contracts

### Batch Coordinator (`batch-coordinator`)

Manages the creation, tracking, and execution of complex batch processes.

Key features:
- Multi-step workflow definition
- Parallel and sequential batch processing
- Dynamic task allocation
- Progress tracking and verification

### Task Registry (`task-registry`)

Handles task metadata, status tracking, and verification mechanisms.

Key features:
- Task creation and lifecycle management
- Detailed task metadata storage
- Flexible status tracking
- Automated verification hooks

### Reward Allocation (`reward-allocation`)

Manages incentives and compensation for batch process participants.

Key features:
- Configurable reward models
- Performance-based compensation
- Transparent fund distribution
- Reputation tracking

### Batch Treasury (`batch-treasury`)

Secures and manages funds associated with batch processes.

Key features:
- Secure fund escrow
- Multi-signature fund release
- Granular allocation controls
- Comprehensive transaction logging

## Getting Started

1. Deploy contracts to Stacks blockchain
2. Initialize batch processes
3. Define task workflows
4. Configure reward mechanisms
5. Manage fund allocations

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Batch Process
```clarity
(contract-call? .batch-coordinator create-batch
    "Data Migration"
    "Large-scale data transfer process"
    u10 ;; Maximum steps
    u75  ;; Completion threshold
)
```

### Registering a Task
```clarity
(contract-call? .task-registry register-task
    "Data Validation"
    "Verify and sanitize batch data"
    u2   ;; Priority level
    none ;; Optional category
)
```

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature authorization
- Role-based access controls
- Atomic transaction verification
- Comprehensive event logging
